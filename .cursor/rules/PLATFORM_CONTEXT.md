## 5. Multi-Tenant Data Architecture and Isolation

### 5.1 Data Guard Service Architecture

The Data Guard Service ensures complete tenant isolation through a multi-layered approach:

#### Database-Level Isolation

```sql
-- Tenant-aware database schema design
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_001_edutech;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_002_university;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_003_individual;

-- Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON users
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);

-- Enhanced tenant isolation with additional security layers
CREATE POLICY tenant_data_access_policy ON all_tenant_tables
    FOR ALL TO authenticated_users
    USING (
        tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid 
        AND 
        auth.uid() IN (
            SELECT user_id FROM tenant_users 
            WHERE tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid
        )
    );
```

#### Application-Level Isolation
- **Tenant Context Middleware**: Ensures all requests include tenant identification
- **Data Access Layer**: Automatic tenant filtering on all database queries
- **API Gateway**: Tenant-based routing and request validation
- **Service Mesh**: Inter-service communication with tenant context propagation

#### Infrastructure-Level Isolation
- **Database Sharding**: Logical separation of tenant data
- **Storage Partitioning**: Isolated file storage per tenant
- **Cache Namespacing**: Tenant-specific cache keys and data
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated network traffic per tenant

### 5.2 Enhanced Data Guard Service Components

#### Tenant Management Service

```typescript
interface TenantConfiguration {
  tenantId: string;
  tenantType: 'individual' | 'institution' | 'edutech';
  dataResidency: string;
  encryptionLevel: 'standard' | 'enhanced' | 'maximum';
  backupSchedule: BackupConfiguration;
  auditLevel: 'basic' | 'detailed' | 'comprehensive';
  complianceRequirements: ComplianceFramework[];
  dataRetentionPolicy: RetentionPolicy;
  crossTenantSharingRules: SharingRules;
}

interface ComplianceFramework {
  standard: 'FERPA' | 'GDPR' | 'COPPA' | 'HIPAA' | 'SOX';
  requirements: ComplianceRequirement[];
  auditSchedule: AuditSchedule;
  reportingRequirements: ReportingRequirement[];
}
```

#### Advanced Data Encryption and Security
- **Field-level encryption** for sensitive data (PII, grades, assessments)
- **Tenant-specific encryption keys** managed through AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault
- **Data masking** for cross-tenant analytics (where permitted)
- **Zero-knowledge encryption** for highly sensitive educational records
- **Homomorphic encryption** for privacy-preserving analytics

#### Comprehensive Audit and Compliance
- **Comprehensive audit trails** per tenant with immutable logging
- **FERPA, GDPR, and regional compliance** enforcement
- **Data retention policies** configurable per tenant with automated enforcement
- **Export and portability** features for data sovereignty
- **Real-time compliance monitoring** and alerting
- **Automated compliance reporting** and documentation
