### Data Isolation Strategy

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- Example tenant isolation policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON users
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);

CREATE POLICY tenant_data_access_policy ON all_tenant_tables
    FOR ALL TO authenticated_users
    USING (
        tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid 
        AND 
        auth.uid() IN (
            SELECT user_id FROM tenant_users 
            WHERE tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid
        )
    );
```

#### Tenant Context Management
- **Application-Level**: Middleware ensures tenant context in all requests
- **Database-Level**: Row-level security policies enforce data isolation
- **API-Level**: Tenant-aware routing and validation
- **Cache-Level**: Tenant-specific cache namespacing
