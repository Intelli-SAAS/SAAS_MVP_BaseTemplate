## Purpose

This document serves as a centralized repository for tracking all AI prompts used in the development of the EduSpry platform. By maintaining a record of effective prompts, we can:

1. Ensure consistent high-quality outputs across the project
2. Reuse successful prompts for similar tasks
3. Document the development process and design decisions
4. Train new team members on effective prompt engineering
5. Continuously improve our prompting techniques

## How to Use This Document

1. When using an AI assistant for any significant development task, record your prompt in this document
2. Include the date, purpose, prompt text, and a brief note about the results
3. Tag the prompt with relevant categories for easy reference
4. If you improve an existing prompt, update it and note the changes

## Prompts Library

### Architecture & Design Prompts

#### Initial Architecture Planning

**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Purpose:** Create high-level architecture documentation  
**Tags:** #architecture #documentation #planning

```
Review the docs folder and create high-level Architecture.md and TechnicalDetails.md files for the EduSpry multi-tenant educational platform project based on the available documentation.
```

**Notes:** Successfully generated comprehensive architecture documentation covering multi-tenant design, technology stack, data architecture, security considerations, and implementation details.

## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

1. **Be specific and detailed** - Include as much context as possible
2. **Include clear instructions** - Specify the expected format and desired outcome
3. **Use examples** - Provide examples when appropriate to guide the output
4. **Break down complex tasks** - Split complex tasks into smaller, more manageable prompts
5. **Iterate and refine** - If the first result isn't ideal, refine your prompt and try again

*This document should be regularly updated with new prompts as the project progresses.*
